# Unit #1
## Beginnings - 600 BCE

### Overview:
* Where did humans come from and how did those early communities function?
* How did the advent of agriculture change human society (Neolithic Revolution)?

### Section 1 – The origin of humans and early human societies
* #### History and prehistory
  * Anatomically modern humans have been around for 200,000 years
  * Writing is our main tool for history
  * **Anthropology** - The study of present and past humans and human society
  * **Archeology** focuses on the past study of humans and human society
  * **Paleontology** techniques can be useful for old human remains or even pre-human remains
  * **Radiocarbon Dating** uses the ratio of Carbon-14 to Nitrogen-14 to figure out how old things are
    * Carbon-14 decays into Nitrogen-14
    * It takes 5,730 years for half of the Carbon-14 to decay
  * **Stratigraphy** - Looking at various layers of the Earth
  * History is constantly evolving as we learn more

* #### Prehistory before written records
  * Scholars define **prehistory** as events that occurred before the existence of written records in a given culture or society
  * **History** refers to the time period after the invention of written records in a given culture or society
  * Archeologists have discovered written records in Egypt from as early as 3200 BCE, which is the accepted date at which history “begins” there
  * Written records give historians resources to deal with that are more detailed in some way than other records, such as archeological or biological remains

* #### Homo sapiens and early human migration
  * _Homo sapiens_, the first modern humans, evolved from their early hominid predecessors between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago
  * They developed a capacity for language about 50,000 years ago
  * The first modern humans began moving outside of Africa starting about 70,000 - 100,000 years ago
  * Humans are the only known species to have successfully populated, adapted to, and significantly altered a wide variety of land regions across the world, resulting in profound historical and environmental impacts
  * Hominids were the earliest humanlike creatures
  * They diverged from other primates somewhere between2.5 and 4 million years ago in eastern and southern Africa
  * Hominids all shared the trait of **bipedalism**, the ability to walk upright on two legs
  * The **aridity hypothesis** suggests that early hominids were more suited to dry climates and evolved as Africa’s dry savannah regions expanded
  * The **savannah hypothesis** suggests early tree-dwelling hominids may have been pushed out of their homes as forest regions shrank and the savannah expanded
  * Approximately 2.3 million years ago Homo habilis began to make simple tools
  * By one million years ago Homo erectus began to migrate out of Africa and into Eurasia
  * There were once many kinds of hominids
  * Only Homo sapiens remain
  * **Extinction** is a normal part of evolution
  * Homo sapiens reached the Australian continent in canoes sometime between 35,000 and 65,000 years ago
  * The Pleistocene Ice Age created a land bridge that connected Asia and North America over 13,000 years ago
  * The development of **language** around 50,000 years ago allowed people to make plans, solve problems, and organize effectively
  * Once humans were able to communicate their concerns and make plans they could assess whether the pressured in their current home outweighed the risk of leaving to find a new one
  * Clothing was made out of animal skins and fires were constructed to help in warmer climates
  * Sophisticated weapons allowed killing large mammals more efficiently and contributed to the extinction of giant land mammals
  * Humans started shifting from nomadic lifestyles to fixed homes to make better use of natural resources in semi-permanent **settlements** which helped establish communities and the development of agriculture.

* #### Peopling the Earth
  * **Hominidae** (human-like) is the family that includes human beings
  * Further divided into _Hominidae_ and _Pongidae_
  * _Pongidae_ goes to the genus **Pongo**, which is orangutans
  * _Hominidae_ is divided into the sub-tribes _Grollini_ (Gorillas) and _Hominini_
  * _Hominini_ splits into the genus **Pan** and the genus **Homo**
  * **Pan** includes chimpanzees and bonobos
  * The last time we had a common ancestor with what would eventually become chimpanzees was about 5 million years ago
  * those creatures which would one day become human beings were _arboreal simians_, ape-like or monkey-like creatures that lived in trees, ate mostly fruit, and were mostly quadrupeds
  * Research indicates their diets didn’t change when they came down from trees
  * **Australopithecus afarensis** (_Southern Ape from the Afar region_) is the most notable example of a creature which left the trees and began walking upright
  * The most famous Australopithecus afarensis to be found was a woman named Lucy in 1974 who is believed to be 3 million years old
  * **Paranthropus aethiopicus**, meaning near-human from Ethiopia, is from about 2.5 million years ago
    * Skull had a sagittal crest where the temporalis muscle was anchored
  * **Homo erectus**, meaning upright human, is from about 2 million years ago to about 700,000 years ago
    * Skull did not have a sagittal crest but had a sagittal ridge

* #### Paleolithic Societies
  * Paleolithic Societies were largely dependent on foraging and hunting
  * While hominid species evolved through natural selection for millions of years, cultural evolution accounts for most of the significant changes in the history of Homo sapiens
  * Small bands of hunter-gatherers lived, worked, and migrated together before the advent of agriculture
  * **Paleolithic** means “Old Stone [Age],” but the Paleolithic era refers to when foraging, hunting, and fishing were humans primary means of obtaining food
  * Hunter-gatherer systems began to transform about 11,000 years ago
  * **Sociocultural evolution** - the ways in which early human societies created culture
  * Paleolithic humans were not simply cave men who were concerned only with conquering their next meal
  * **Culture** is a broad term which encompasses the full range of learned human behavior patterns, behaviors which are often linked to survival.

* #### Paleolithic technology, culture, and art
  * Paleolithic groups developed increasingly complex tools and objects made of stone and natural fibers
  * Language, art, scientific inquiry, and spiritual life were some of the most important innovations of the Paleolithic era
  * Names of the Paleolithic periods are based on the progression of tools: **Lower Paleolithic**, **Upper Paleolithic**, **Mesolithic** (Middle Stone Age), and **Neolithic** (New Stone Age)
  * Approximately 40,000 years ago narrow stone blades and tools made of bone, ivory, and antler appeared
  * 20,000 years ago the first known needles were produced
  * Between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago more complicated instruments like barbed harpoons and spear-throwers were produced
  * The Neolithic “Ice Man” was preserved in ice for 5,000 years in the Ötztal Alps with a set of stone and natural-fiber tools, including a six-foot longbow, deerskin case, fourteen arrows, a stick with an antler tip for sharpening flint blades, a small flint dagger in a woven sheath, a copper axe, and a medicine bag

* #### Organizing paleolithic societies
  * Human beings around the world were using tools
  * Early humans ate a Paleo diet consisting of naturally growing fruits, vegetable matters, animals that they could catch and kill, and wild grains
  * The first evidence of grain harvesting shows up in North Africa about 16,000 years ago
  * Resources were limited so constant movement was necessary
  * Primitive huts and tents were built for temporary residence
  * Tools start to get smaller and more specific
  * Hunting animals become safer and easier resulting in more food
  * Mortar and pestle made it easier to eat wheat
  * Gobekli Tepe is a monument built by nonagricultural people
